# Intro to Python

## Programming Language

- A language that writes programs for computers.

## Program

- Set of instructions that computers know hot to execute
- Converts programming language commands/instructions in machine learning.

## Data

- Different Data
- Depends on the programming language
- Integers (1, 2, 3, 0, -5, 12312, ...) whole numbers
- Floats (3.5, -4.12, .7.124124) - decimal
- Strings ("Hello", "123456", "") - plain text
- Boolean (just like binary, 0's and 1's) - a data type which only has 2x possible values. True or false (1 = true, 0 = false)

## Variables

- Container (contains a value)
    - We give the variable a name and it will contain our piece of data
    - Whenever we want that data, we can call the variable
    - The variable can also be changed as we want

## REPL

- Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
